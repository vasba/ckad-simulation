# Question 24 | Service misconfiguration

There seems to be an issue in Namespace mars where the ClusterIP service manager-api-svc should make the Pods of Deployment
manager-api-deployment available inside the cluster.

You can test this with curl manager-api-svc.mars:4444 from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod. Check for the misconfiguration and
apply a fix.
