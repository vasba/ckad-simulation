# Question 6 | ReadinessProbe

## Task
Create a single Pod named `pod6` in Namespace `default` of image `busybox:1.31.0`. The Pod should have a readiness-probe executing `cat /tmp/ready`. It should initially wait 5 and periodically wait 10 seconds. This will set the container ready only if the file `/tmp/ready` exists.

The Pod should run the command `touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d`, which will create the necessary file to be ready and then idles.

Create the Pod and confirm it starts.
