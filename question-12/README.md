# Question 12 | Storage, PV, PVC, Pod volume

## Task
Create a new PersistentVolume named `earth-project-earthflower-pv`. It should have a capacity of `2Gi`, accessMode `ReadWriteOnce`, hostPath `/Volumes/Data` and no storageClassName defined.

Next create a new PersistentVolumeClaim in Namespace `earth` named `earth-project-earthflower-pvc`. It should request `2Gi` storage, accessMode `ReadWriteOnce` and should not define a storageClassName. The PVC should bound to the PV correctly.

Finally create a new Deployment `project-earthflower` in Namespace `earth` which mounts that volume at `/tmp/project-data`. The Pods of that Deployment should be of image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine`.
