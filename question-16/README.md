# Question 16 | Logging sidecar

## Task
The Tech Lead of Mercury2D decided it's time for more logging, to finally fight all these missing data incidents. There is an existing container named `cleaner-con` in Deployment `cleaner` in Namespace `mercury`. This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called `cleaner.log`.

The yaml for the existing Deployment is available at `$HOME/ckad-simulation/16/cleaner.yaml`. Persist your changes at `$HOME/ckad-simulation/16/cleaner-new.yaml` but also make sure the Deployment is running.

Create a sidecar container named `logger-con`, image `busybox:1.31.0`, which mounts the same volume and writes the content of `cleaner.log` to stdout, you can use the `tail -f` command for this. This way it can be picked up by `kubectl logs`.

Check if the logs of the new container reveal something about the missing data incidents.
