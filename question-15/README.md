# Question 15 | ConfigMap, Configmap-Volume

## Task
Team Moonpie has a nginx server Deployment called `web-moon` in Namespace `moon`. Someone started configuring it but it was never completed. To complete please create a ConfigMap called `configmap-web-moon-html` containing the content of file `$HOME/ckad-simulation/15/web-moon.html` under the data key-name `index.html`.

The Deployment `web-moon` is already configured to work with this ConfigMap and serve its content. Test the nginx configuration for example using curl from a temporary `nginx:alpine` Pod.
