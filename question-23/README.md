# Question 23 | InitContainer

Last lunch you told your coworker from department Mars Inc how amazing InitContainers are. Now he would like to see one in action.
There is a Deployment yaml at $HOME/ckad-simulation/23/test-init-container.yaml . This Deployment spins up a single Pod of image
nginx:1.17.3-alpine and serves files from a mounted volume, which is empty right now.

Create an InitContainer named init-con which also mounts that volume and creates a file index.html with content "check this
out!" in the root of the mounted volume. For this test we ignore that it doesn't contain valid html.

The InitContainer should be using image busybox:1.31.0 . Test your implementation for example using curl from a temporary
nginx:alpine Pod.
