# Question 10 | Service, Logs

## Task
Team Pluto needs a new cluster internal Service. Create a ClusterIP Service named `project-plt-6cc-svc` in Namespace `pluto`. This Service should expose a single Pod named `project-plt-6cc-api` of image `nginx:1.17.3-alpine`, create that Pod as well. The Pod should be identified by label `project: plt-6cc-api`. The Service should use tcp port redirection of `3333:80`.

Finally use for example curl from a temporary `nginx:alpine` Pod to get the response from the Service. Write the response into `$HOME/ckad-simulation/10/service_test.html`. Also check if the logs of Pod `project-plt-6cc-api` show the request and write those into `service_test.log`.
