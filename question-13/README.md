# Question 13 | Storage, StorageClass, PVC

## Task
Team Moonpie, which has the Namespace `moon`, needs more storage. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim named `moon-pvc-126` in that namespace. This claim should use a new StorageClass `moon-retain` with the provisioner set to `moon-retainer` and the reclaimPolicy set to `Retain`. The claim should request storage of `3Gi`, an accessMode of `ReadWriteOnce` and should use the new StorageClass.

The provisioner `moon-retainer` will be created by another team, so it's expected that the PVC will not boot yet. Confirm this by writing the event message from the PVC into file `$HOME/ckad-simulation/13/pvc-126-reason`.
