# Question 7 | Pods, Namespaces

## Task
The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce system is called `my-happy-shop`.

Search for the correct Pod in Namespace `saturn` and move it to Namespace `neptune`. It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways.

Save the moved pod specification into webserver.yaml
