# Question 8 | Deployment, Rollouts

## Task
There is an existing Deployment named `api-new-c32` in Namespace `neptune`. A developer did make an update to the Deployment but the updated version never came online. Check the Deployment history and find a revision that works, then rollback to it. Could you tell Team Neptune what the error was so it doesn't happen again?
