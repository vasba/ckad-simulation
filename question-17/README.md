# Question 17 | Network Policy

## Task
In Namespace venus you'll find two Deployments named api and frontend . Both Deployments are exposed inside the cluster using
Services. Create a NetworkPolicy named np1 which restricts outgoing tcp connections from Deployment frontend and only allows
those going to Deployment api . Make sure the NetworkPolicy still allows outgoing traffic on UDP/TCP ports 53 for DNS resolution.

Test using: wget www.google.com and wget api:2222 from a Pod of Deployment frontend .
